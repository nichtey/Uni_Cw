Heat Transfer

This project was used to model heat flow through a car exhuast pipe that was fitted with a cordierite
catalyst. Assumptions and simplifications that were used are explained in the pdf document. The change
in temperature with time for 1 cross section of the pipe containing the catalyst is illustrated in
the video file.

Does the following:
1) Model temperature change of pipe and catalyst
2) Model carbon monoxide emitted with time, and how changing a catalyst affects the CO emission
