    "# In this coding challenge, you will be asked to use what you have learned so far\n",
    "# to try and \"computationally\" solve a realistic problem in materials science.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem is the following.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# A materials exists that is able to trap bacteria on it. This coating can be deposited as a series of N stripes of \n",
    "# width d, and N+1 stripes (without coating) of width d2, so that N*d + (N+1)*d2 = L, L being the size of the \n",
    "# surface, a square of L*L. We would like to understand what is the best value in terms of N and d that will allow \n",
    "# to make bacteria die faster.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Why would bacteria die faster when trapped? Mainly, because they have less space to find food required to survive.\n",
    "# At the same time, bacteria that are close to each other can form stronger colonies, in the sense that the probability\n",
    "# for a bacteria to die because it has no food will depend on how many are present in its colony, so over-concentrating them in a single region\n",
    "# might not be the best thing to do.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Your \"playground\" for testing is a model where you have different colonies of bacteria (we'll specify it in a \n",
    "# second), residing on a square surface (your material) which has N stripes each of size d of coating. Beside\n",
    "# bacteria, the surface also contains food.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#\n",
    "# You are given the following rules for the behaviour of bacteria.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1) Each bacteria have a rate k_die that it will die. This means that in a time-step dt, the bacteria will die\n",
    "#    with probability k_die( xx ). xx is the number of neighbours for a certain bacteria. This number is the \n",
    "#    number of bacteria whose Voronoi cell (considering only bacteria of the same colony) is adjacent to the \n",
    "#    Voronoi cell of the bacteria (i.e., they share an edge). The formula for it is\n",
    "#    k_die( xx ) = k_die( 0 ) / xx \n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2) A bacteria can duplicate with a rate k_replicate.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3) A bacteria can move with rate k_move. If it moves, its displacement in the x and y direction is taken \n",
    "#    taken from a Gaussian probability with mean = X and standard deviation = sigma  normal( mean, std ) -\n",
    "#    note that DX and DY must be taken independently.\n",
    "#    Importantly, if a bacteria is inside a coated region, the movement is allowed only if it keeps the bacteria \n",
    "#    in the coated region and rejected otherwise. A movement is also rejected if it brings the bacteria outside \n",
    "#    the surface.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In practice, this means that at each step of evolution, you should pick for every bacteria 1) or 2) or 3) based\n",
    "# on the formula\n",
    "#\n",
    "# p_i = k_i / sum(i) k_i, i=1,3 and p_i is the probability to do the corresponding action\n",
    "#\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4) If a bacteria lands within a distance R_eat of a piece of food, it eats it (immediately, in the same step). \n",
    "#    A bacteria that has just eaten cannot die for the next 10 steps.\n",

    "#\n",
    "# COLONY:\n",
    "# Each bacteria belongs to one colony. The area of the colony is defined as the area of the convex hull \n",
    "# formed by the bacteria. Different bacterial colonies can interact with each other if their convex hull \n",
    "# overlaps( see Note 1 below ). The interaction between colonies can be different. \n",
    "#\n",
    "# If the colonies interact in synergy, once they overlap they merge together in a single colony.\n",
    "# If colonies compete, if they overlap bacteria kill each other through a fight (all within the same evolution step) \n",
    "# until their colonies do not overlap anymore in the following way: two bacteria (1 and 2), taken one each \n",
    "# randomly from the two different colonies fight each other based on their strength (S_1 or S_2). In practice, \n",
    "# the surviror is taken randomly with a probability that is proportional to p_1 =  S_1 / ( S_1 + S_2 ) and \n",
